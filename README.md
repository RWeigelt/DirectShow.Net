# RWeigelt/DirectShow.Net

A fork of [DirectShow.Net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/directshownet/) which was last published in [https://sourceforge.net/projects/directshownet/files/DirectShowNET/v2.1/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/directshownet/files/DirectShowNET/v2.1/) on February 22, 2010 under the Lesser General Public License Version 2.1.

The purpose of this fork is to make adjustments for using DirectShow.Net in my personal software projects. **This is not an general-purpose enhancement of the original libary**. I only need a very small subset of the functionality, but in order to be LGPL-compliant, the entirety of the library must be kept intact and available publicly. Please note I do not perform any tests of features that go beyond my own (few) requirements.

The first step is to make DirectShow.Net compile to a library that can be used in a .NET 5 desktop application written in C#/WPF.
